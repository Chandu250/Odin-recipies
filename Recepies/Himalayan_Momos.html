<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

<ul>
For the Filling:

Instructions:
<ol>
Prepare the Dough:

<li>In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
<li>Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth, pliable dough.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
Prepare the Filling:

<li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add the chopped onion, grated ginger, and minced garlic. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
<li>Add the mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they are slightly tender.</li>
<li>Stir in the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well and cook for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the filling from the heat and let it cool.</li>
Shape the Momos:

<li>Take a small portion of the dough and roll it into a small disc, about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
<li>Place a spoonful of the prepared vegetable filling in the center of the disc.</li>
Fold the Momos:

<li>Start folding the edges of the disc to create pleats and bring them together in the center. Pinch and twist to seal the momo.</li>
<li>Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
Steam the Momos:

<li>Prepare a steamer by greasing the surface with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Arrange the shaped momos in the steamer, leaving some space between them.</li>
<li>Steam the momos for about 10-15 minutes, or until the dough becomes translucent and the filling is cooked.</li>
Serve:

<li>Once the momos are cooked, carefully remove them from the steamer.</li>
<li>Serve the hot Himalayan vegetable momos with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and a touch of chili sauce.</li>
Note: Momos are a popular street food in the Himalayan region and can be filled with a variety of ingredients such as meat, paneer (Indian cottage cheese), and other vegetables.
 Feel free to experiment with different fillings and dipping sauces to suit your taste.
