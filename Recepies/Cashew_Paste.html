Cashew Curry Recipe

Ingredients:

For the Cashew Paste:
<ul>
<li>1 cup cashew nuts (kaju), soaked in warm water for 2 hours</li>
<li>1/4 cup water (for grinding)</li>
</ul>

For the Curry:
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons oil or ghee</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
<li> tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup heavy cream or yogurt (optional, for creamines</li>s)</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (for garnish)
</ul>
Instructions:
<ol>
    Prepare Cashew Paste:
        
<li>Drain the soaked cashews and place them in a blender.</li>
<li>Add 1/4 cup of water and blend until you get a smooth paste. Set aside.
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
Cook the Curry:

<li>Heat oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and golden brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
Add Spices:

<li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
<li>Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and a pinch of salt. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Create the Cashew Base:

<li>Reduce the heat to low and add the cashew paste to the pan. Mix well to combine with the onion-tomato mixture.</li>
<li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Simmer and Add Liquid:

<li>Pour in 1 cup of water and bring the curry to a gentle simmer. You can adjust the amount of water based on your desired consistency.</li>
<li>Let the curry simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to develop.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Finish the Curry:

<li>If using cream or yogurt, add it to the curry and mix well. This will add creaminess to the curry.</li>
<li>Sprinkle garam masala over the curry and stir it in.</li>
<li>Taste and adjust salt and spices as needed.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Serve:

<li>Once the curry is well-cooked and has a thick consistency, remove it from the heat.</li>
<li>Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro leaves.</li>
</ol>
Enjoy:

Serve the cashew curry hot with steamed rice, naan, or roti. It's a delicious and indulgent dish that's perfect for special occasions or when you want to treat yourself.
Note: You can customize the level of spiciness and creaminess in this curry according to your taste preferences. Feel free to adjust the amount of chili powder and cream/yogurt accordingly.
