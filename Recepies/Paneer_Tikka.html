<ul>Ingredients:

For the Paneer Tikka:

<li>250g paneer (Indian cottage cheese), cut into cubes</li>
<li>1/2 cup thick yogurt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oil</li>

For the Masala Sauce:

<li>2 tablespoons butter or oil</li>
<li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder (for color, not too spicy)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

<li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>

</ul>
<ol>
Instructions:

<li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, cumin powder, garam masala, salt, and oil to make the marinade for the paneer.</li>
<li>Add paneer cubes to the marinade and let them marinate for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F). Thread the marinated paneer cubes onto skewers and place them on a baking tray. You can also cook them on a stovetop
 grill or a non-stick pan if you don't have an oven.</li>
<li>Bake or grill the paneer cubes for about 15-20 minutes or until they are lightly charred and cooked through. If using a stovetop pan, cook until they
 are golden brown on all sides.</li>
<li>In a separate pan, heat butter or oil. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
<li>Add ginger and garlic paste, and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
<li>Add cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, paprika, and garam masala. Sauté for a minute.</li>
<li>Add tomato puree and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Season the masala sauce with salt and adjust the spices according to your taste.</li>
<li>Gently add the cooked paneer cubes to the masala sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
<li>Garnish with chopped cilantro (coriander leaves).</li>
<li>Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala with naan, rice, or roti.</li>
<li>This dish is creamy, rich, and not overly spicy, making it suitable for picky eaters. Enjoy your cooking and your date!</li>
